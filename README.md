# Hey there! 👋 I'm Aditya

## 🚀 About Me
Full-stack developer who writes code that *usually* works on the first try (okay, maybe the third). Currently crafting digital experiences with **React** and **Node.js**, one component at a time.

## 💡 What I'm Up To
- 🔨 Building full-stack applications that solve real problems
- 🐛 Hunting bugs before they hunt me (it's a competitive sport)
- 🎯 Turning coffee into code and ideas into features
- 📚 Always learning, because yesterday's best practices are today's tech debt

## 📬 Let's Connect!
